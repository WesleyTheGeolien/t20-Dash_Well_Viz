## Introduction

This repository is part of the [Software Underground's Transform 2020 hackathon](https://softwareunderground.org/events/2020/6/6/global-hackathon).

The aim is to try and build some interactive log visualisations using dash in notebooks and demonstrate what is possible (and also what the limitations are) using dash on subsurface data.

Ultimately it would be good to try and collate all the examples into a library of templates to share after the Hackathon swung.
